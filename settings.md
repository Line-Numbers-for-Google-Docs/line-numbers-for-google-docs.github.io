If you do not see this icon, please try restarting Chrome and reloading the Google Docs page.

### Settings Description

A quick description of all the settings available in the extension.

#### Show line numbering

This is a checkbox that allows you toggle the visibility of the line numbers.

#### Numbering Type

Changing the numbering type changes the way lines are numbered.

- **Continuous**: line numbers will continuously increment regardless of page or section boundaries.
- **Restart Each Page**: line numbers counts will be reset to the [start at](#start-at) value at the beginning of each page.

#### Start at

This value defines the number to start counting from on each count reset. For example, if this is set to 5, the the first 
line will be numbered as 5. If at any point line numbering is reset, then line counting will also start from 5.

#### Count by

This value defines the step taken in numbering lines. For example, if this value is set to 5, then line numbers will only
appear for lines that are a multiple of 5. So lines 5, 10, 15, and so on will be numbered but not the others.

#### Conditional Numbering

If you want to exclude or include certain parts of the document from the line count these are the settings you want to change.

- **Blank lines**: toggles the numbering or empty/blank lines in the document.
- **Headers**: toggles the numbering of the header sections in the document.
- **Footers**: toggles the numbering of the footer sections in the document.
