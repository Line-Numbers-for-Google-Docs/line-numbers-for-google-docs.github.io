Wait for the extension to finish installing before proceeding.

#### 2. Open your favorite Google Docs file

Head over to **[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)** and open any of your documents or create a new document. If you already have a document open you may need to refresh it for the extension to take effect.

#### 3. Open the line numbering settings

In the **top right** corner of your document you should see a **new icon** injected by the extension â€” click on it to open up the line numbering settings.

If you do not see this icon, please try restarting Chrome and reloading the Google Docs page.

#### 4. Enable line numbering

Check the **Show line numbering** checkbox to enable line numbering in your document.
