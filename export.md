# Export Line Numbers

#### Exporting to PDF

1. In your document go to *File > Print*.
2. Select *Save as PDF* in the *Destination* dropdown menu.
3. Click *Save*.

Note that if line numbers don't appear on all pages, you may need to scroll through the document to have them render.

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, in step 2, try selecting *Save to Google Drive* instead.

#### Export to a Word Document

This is still a work in progress. Say tuned for updates.
