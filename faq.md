# FAQ

### Why are the line number not showing?

If you have properly followed the [quick start guide](quickstart.md) and double-checked that the *Show line numbering* checkbox is checked in your document. Then try to reload the Google Docs documents, restart your browser and check that the extension is enabled by going to *chrome://extensions/* in the URL bar. 

If you still can't see the line numbers on your document please [reach out](contact.md) for help.

### Not all line numbers show up when printing or saving to PDF, why?

This issue may arise when to entire document was not properly loaded. Try scrolling through the entire document before printing or exporting the document to a PDF.

Make sure you follow the instruction found in the [Exporting Line Numbers](export.md) section.

### Can students and academics get a premium subscription for free?

If you are working in academia as a teacher or professor, or are a student then you can [contact me](contact.md) using your academic email address to request a free subscription.

### Why is it slow?

If your document is very big then Google Docs starts slowing down substantially â€” this is a known problem to Google. So the performance problems you are experiencing may have nothing to do with the extension itself.

You should try disabling the extension by going to *chrome://extensions/* in the URL bar. 
Then reload your document and check if the performance problems are still apparent.
If you notice an increase in performance please [contact me](contact.md) so that I can look into it.
